- **Grid System**: Single column layout optimized for mobile-first use
- **Responsive Approach**: Mobile-optimized with desktop enhancement
- **Content Density**: Spacious layout prioritizing usability over information density

### Animations
- **Purposeful Meaning**: Subtle feedback for actions (check/uncheck, add items)
- **Hierarchy of Movement**: Check animations most prominent, add/remove secondary
- **Contextual Appropriateness**: Minimal, functional animations that enhance usability

### UI Elements & Component Selection

- **Edge Case Handling**: Confirmation for clearing list, persistent storage, duplicate prevention
- **Technical Constraints**: Local storage limitations, offline functionality needs

## Implementation Considerations
- **Scalability Needs**: Support for multiple lists, categories, or sharing features
- **Testing Focus**: Touch interaction quality, data persistence, performance with large lists
- **Critical Questions**: How many past items to show? Should items have categories?

## Reflection
- This approach prioritizes speed and pattern recognition over feature richness
- The assumption that users rebuy similar items repeatedly is core to the value proposition
- The solution would be exceptional through its simplicity and learning from user behavior
